## ðŸ’¬ Personal Interests

When I'm not building models or dashboards, you'll find me diving deep into basketball analyticsâ€”especially the NBA. I'm a long-time Celtics fan (despite living in NYC) and an avid collector of NBA Top Shot moments [Collection](https://nbatopshot.com/user/@SplashAttack). Outside of hoops, Iâ€™m a dedicated snowboarder, and I spend as much time as I can riding the powder in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.
